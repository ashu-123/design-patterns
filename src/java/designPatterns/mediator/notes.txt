Behavioral Design pattern

- Helps in reducing the complexity by removing tight coupling between directly interacting objects(colleagues)
by introducing a mediator in between them
- Centralizes logic for interaction between objects & reduces direct dependencies among interacting classes

Should not be used in the following scenarios:-
- when there isn't too much or too complex interactions between objects
- when the mediator itself becomes a complex class / 'A God Object'
